"""Deploy one team's service, carrying its WHOLE incident. NOT FOR PARTICIPANTS.

An incident's configuration lives in two halves. Some of it is lever-settable
(`MAX_TOKENS`, `SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `MODEL_TIER`...) and some is deploy-only
(`stage delay`, `provider fault`, `thinking budget`, the model behind a tier).
Calibration papers over the difference, because the calibrator applies the lever
half over `/levers` after the service is up.

A real team's service has no such step. It has to be born with both halves, and
deploying only the injection produces services that are wrong in ways that look
like nothing:

    decode      deployed at MAX_TOKENS=32 with Pro + thinking, and answered
                every question with the single word "Hello"
    cheapmodel  deployed without MODEL_TIER, so it ran the LARGE model and the
                incident simply was not there
    staleness   deployed without SEMANTIC_CACHE_THRESHOLD, so it ran at 0.92
                and the incident simply was not there

Usage:
    python facilitators/deploy_incident.py --incident decode --service nimbus-team-a
    python facilitators/deploy_incident.py --incident decode --service nimbus-team-a --run
    python facilitators/deploy_incident.py --all --prefix nimbus-team   # the whole room
