"""Measure answer groundedness, so the eval card is data rather than invention.

This is a KEYWORD-GROUNDEDNESS PROXY, not a real quality eval: for each question
we know which fact the course notes contain, and we check whether the answer
actually contains it. It cannot detect fluent nonsense, tone, or partial
correctness, and a real eval would use human labels or a judge model.

It is deliberately shipped anyway, because a crude measured number beats a
confident invented one -- and the gap between this and a real eval is exactly
the point the activity makes about quality being the expensive axis.

Usage:  .venv/bin/python facilitators/eval.py            # current server config

# Two tiers, because they measure different things.
#
# EXTRACTION: the answer sits verbatim in a retrieved chunk. Any model that can
# copy will pass these, so they mostly measure whether RETRIEVAL worked.
#
# REASONING: the answer requires combining notes, or applying a rule to a
# situation the notes do not state directly. These are where model capability
# actually shows up -- and they are the questions students genuinely need help
# with. A model that aces extraction and fails reasoning is exactly the failure
# mode that a naive eval misses.

# (question, any-of these terms means the answer carried the fact through)
