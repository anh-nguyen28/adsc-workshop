"""Generate the frozen question corpus.

Duplicates are DELIBERATE: during finals week many students ask the same thing
in the same words, and a few ask it in different words. That mix is what gives
the cache levers something real to hit.

The corpus is built from a REPEATING TEMPLATE rather than by random sampling,
because the duplicate structure has to survive truncation. The benchmark sends
the first N questions; if repeats were merely sprinkled across all 60 rows, a
16-request run would contain almost none and caching would look useless.
Cycling a fixed pattern guarantees the same mix at every prefix length.
