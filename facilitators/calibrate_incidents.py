"""Measure every incident's signature, and refuse to ship a collision.

NOT FOR PARTICIPANTS.

The signature matrix in any design document is a hypothesis. This produces the
shipped one from measurement, the same way the eval card and the answer key are
produced -- because the property the activity depends on is not "these incidents
look different in principle", it is "these incidents measurably looked different
on the hardware the room will use".

The check that matters runs at the end: for every PAIR of incidents, at least
one signal must differ by more than measurement noise. If two incidents move the
same signals by the same amounts, a participant diagnosing one of them is
guessing, and the room correctly concludes that diagnosis does not work. That is
a build failure, not a footnote.

Each incident gets its own server process, because injection is configured by
environment variable and a running process cannot be handed a new environment --
which is also exactly how Cloud Run behaves.
