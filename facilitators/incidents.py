"""The incident catalog. NOT FOR PARTICIPANTS.

01_deploy/incident.py holds the mechanism; this file holds the answers. The
split is the point: a participant with the whole repository checked out can read
the mechanism and learn that a retrieval delay is possible, but not that theirs
is one. Everything below reaches a running service as deploy-time environment
variables, so it is never present in the code they can see.

Two rules govern the set.

UNIQUE DISCRIMINATORS. Every incident owns at least one signal that no other
incident moves. If two incidents move the same signals by the same amounts the
diagnosis is a coin flip, and the room correctly concludes that diagnosis does
not work. `calibrate_incidents.py` checks this against measured data and fails
rather than shipping a collision.

QUEUE STARVATION MASKS EVERYTHING. The shipped default admits 2 requests while
the benchmark offers 8, so queue wait dominates the ledger no matter what else
is wrong. That IS the queue incident -- and it would flatten every other
signature into the same shape. So each non-queue incident raises MAX_CONCURRENT
to the benchmark's concurrency, which takes the queue out of the story and lets
the injected fault be the story.
"""

# Taking the queue out of the story: OFFER less traffic, do not admit more.
#
# Raising MAX_CONCURRENT to the benchmark's concurrency looks equivalent and is
# not. Admitting 8 concurrent generations on a box with 4 cores does not create
# capacity; it relocates the waiting from the queue into generation, so every
# non-queue incident measured 96% "generate" and the panel would have told
# participants the model was at fault in all of them. Offering traffic at the
# admission limit leaves the queue empty AND the cores uncontended, so the
# injected fault is the only thing left to find.
#
# Traffic shape is part of an incident's definition, not a global constant --
# different incidents are reported by different traffic in the real world too.
