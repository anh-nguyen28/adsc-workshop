# Part 2 — Deploy Nimbus

Goal: get Nimbus running, reachable, and answering questions. Five minutes.

---

## 1. Set up locally with Docker

The complete local deployment uses Docker Compose: Ollama serves a free local
Llama model, Nimbus provides the FastAPI/RAG proxy, and the benchmark runs in
the Nimbus container. No cloud credentials are needed.

From the repository root:

```bash
make docker-up
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
make docker-bench
```

The first start pulls `llama3.1:8b` into the persistent `ollama-models` volume.
Set `NIMBUS_OLLAMA_MODEL_SMALL` and/or `NIMBUS_OLLAMA_MODEL_LARGE` before
`make docker-up` to use another Ollama-compatible 8B–14B-class model.

Stop it with:

```bash
make docker-down
```

## 2. Set up with Python (lightweight workshop path)

```bash
make setup
```

This creates a virtualenv, installs the pinned dependencies from
`requirements.txt`, and builds the course-note index. If you are in Codespaces
this has already happened for you.

## 3. Start it

```bash
make serve
```

You should see:

```
Nimbus ready | 48 note chunks | tier=large concurrency=2x1 max_tokens=32
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

The first start takes a few seconds because **both model tiers load before the
server accepts traffic**. That is deliberate — see "Why it is built this way"
below.

## 4. Ask it something

In a second terminal:

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"question":"What does the learning rate do?"}'
```

You get a stream of text, and then a final event with the numbers that matter:

```json
{"stats": {"queue_wait_ms": 0.0, "compute_ms": 4584.9,
           "stages_ms": {"retrieve": 193.7, "generate": 4383.9},
           "tokens_in": 772, "tokens_out": 39,
           "cache": "miss", "tier": "large"}}
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in a browser for the participant deployment
activity view. It checks `/health` to show whether the service is live, then
renders a request trace as the answer streams: capacity check, cache lookup,
course-note retrieval, prompt assembly, model routing, generation, and
completion. The trace also shows the note excerpts selected for grounding and
the queue-wait versus compute split. These are operational signals, not the
model's private reasoning.

The SSE stream includes `trace` events in addition to answer deltas and the
final `stats` event. Existing clients can ignore them; the benchmark does.

## 5. Put it on the internet (optional, Codespaces only)

```bash
make public
```

This makes port 8000 publicly reachable and prints a URL like
`https://<you>-8000.app.github.dev`. Anyone can call it. Your service is live.

> If your organisation blocks public port forwarding, skip this. Nothing else
> in the activity depends on it.

## Cloud Run path

For a shared participant URL, use the Cloud Run deployment in the repository
root. The FastAPI app in this folder is already the backend proxy; it calls a
Google-managed model when `NIMBUS_MODEL_BACKEND=google` and uses ADC from the
Cloud Run runtime service account. See [`deploy/README.md`](../deploy/README.md)
for the cloud-owner inputs, secret setup, and deployment command.

The cloud container builds the course-note embedding/index artifact once. It
does not package the local LLM weights, and it does not require a GPU. Admin
routes (`/metrics` and `/reload`) require `X-Nimbus-Admin-Token` in Cloud Run;
participant `/` and `/ask` remain public for the workshop.

---

## Why it is built this way

**Models load once, at startup, never inside a request handler.** Loading a
model per request is the most common LLM deployment mistake there is. Here it
would also make every number you measure meaningless. In cloud mode the LLM is
managed by Google; Nimbus validates credentials at startup and keeps retrieval
dependencies local.

**Nimbus retrieves before it generates.** It is a small RAG service, not a bare
chat wrapper:

```
request -> [shed?] -> [queue] -> [cache] -> [retrieve] -> [generate] -> done
           |__________________|            |_________________________|
                 QUEUE WAIT                        COMPUTE
```

That split matters more than anything else in this repo. **An overloaded queue
and a slow model look identical from the outside and have opposite fixes.** If
you cannot see them separately, you cannot diagnose anything — you can only
guess and spend money.

**Retrieval is one numpy dot product**, not a vector database. The index is 48
chunks of 384 floats — well under a megabyte. A vector DB here would add a
service to run, a port to bind and a new way for this to fail on the day, in
exchange for nothing.

**Responses stream.** Without a first-chunk timestamp there is no TTFT, and TTFT
is half of what the benchmark measures.

---

## What you edit

For the local workshop, `config.py` is the control panel: change one setting,
reload, and benchmark. The service code is provided so every team measures the
same request path. For Cloud Run, use `deploy/cloudrun.env` for deployment and
runtime settings; do not edit the image or add credentials to the repository.

The local defaults ship with every lever off or expensive. That is the
incident.

```
config.py       ★ the levers — this is your control panel
app.py          the service: request path, timing, streaming
model.py        lightweight Hugging Face local adapter
ollama_model.py Docker-local Ollama/Llama adapter
cloud_model.py    Google-managed model adapter used by Cloud Run
retrieval.py      course-note search
levers.py         caches, router, and the long, trimmed, or verbose prompt
timing.py         the queue-wait / compute stopwatch
web/index.html    participant browser page
```

Open `config.py` now and read it. Do not change anything yet — go and measure
first. **Part 3 is where you find out what is actually wrong.**

---

## Useful commands

```bash
make metrics          # what config is the running server actually using?
make reload           # apply your config.py edit and clear answer caches
make serve PORT=8080  # run on a different port

# Docker-local equivalents
make docker-metrics
make docker-reload
```

For Cloud Run, export `NIMBUS_URL` and `NIMBUS_ADMIN_TOKEN` before `make
metrics` or `make reload`. Participants only need the service URL and use the
browser page at `/`.

After every change to `config.py`, run `make reload`, then run the benchmark
again. Reloading keeps the models warm and clears response caches, so each
configuration is measured fairly. If reload fails, stop `make serve` with
Ctrl-C and start it again.
